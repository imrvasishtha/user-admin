1.) **Clone **

`git clone https://github.com/imrvasishtha/user-admin.git`

2.) **To Install an npm package**

a.) `npm install` run at the root directory 

3.) **Setup an env**
I have added .env.development, it should work for you, generally we don't include it in git but for testing purpose.

To Run API `npm run start`

## Documentation
I have added swagger documentation for api, it will work on http://[PORTADDRESS]/documentation (e.g. http://localhost:9000/documentation)
